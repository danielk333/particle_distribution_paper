In the paper 'The use of particle distributions in solar system small body
dynamics' it was proposed that Importance Sampling would be very beneficial to
future statistical simulation of solar system small body dynamics.  More
specifically, for meteoroid simulation.

To illustrate and test the methodology outlined in the paper we set up a
forward model.

This forward model is the contents of this repository. As this is a *test
model* it is not documented, unit-tested, or of production quality! It is meant
to illustrate a point and prototype the method.

**WARNING:** Planetary states are NOT cached in this version of the code: thus
the MCMC sampler performs unnecessary calculations on each iteration as opposed
to the DMC sampler. However a update to used cached states would make the
execution time per iteration identical between the DMC and MCMC codes. As such,
when examining results, one can regard the execution time per iteration as the
same.


In this model a particle is initialized at 2004-01-01 with orbital parameters:

 - Perihelion distance: 0.95 AU
 - Eccentricity: 0.6
 - Inclination: 78 deg 
 - Argument of periapsis: 180 deg 
 - Longitude of ascending node: 0 deg 
 - True anomaly: 180 deg


The model has two parameters: Velocity perturbation in the direction of orbital
motion vx and velocity perturbation in the radial direction (with respect to
the sun) vy.  We sampled the model and then propagated the particles with the
REBOUND propagators python implementation using the IAS15 integrator.  The
integration included all planets initialized with the JPL de-430 planetary
ephemerides. 

The REBOUND code is freely available at http://github.com/hannorein/rebound.


**NOTE**: Please contact me if you intend to implement this method in any
production level code: we are currently building a large scale toolbox based
upon this test model and to minimize the "reinvention of the wheel" we could
collaborate on our respective projects.
